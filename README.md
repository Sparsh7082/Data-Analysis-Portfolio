#### Goal
Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

#### Description
Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago, seeks to maximize the number of annual memberships. The company aims to understand the different usage patterns of casual riders and annual members to design effective marketing strategies that convert casual riders into annual members. The analysis follows the steps of the data analysis process—Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act—to derive insights and recommendations.

#### Results
The analysis revealed that annual members use Cyclistic bikes for regular commuting during peak hours on weekdays, with shorter and more frequent trips, while casual riders predominantly use bikes for leisure on weekends and holidays, resulting in longer but fewer trips. Both groups prefer classic bikes, with casual riders showing a notable preference for docked bikes leading to the longest ride durations. Revenue from annual members is more stable and predictable, contributing significantly to profitability. Popular stations like Streeter Dr & Grand Ave are favored by casual riders, and both groups peak in usage during summer months. The data highlights a substantial opportunity to convert engaged casual riders into annual members through targeted marketing strategies utilizing digital media.
